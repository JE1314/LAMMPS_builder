This software generates a LAMMPS(22 Jul 2016-ICMS) datafile and basic input file for systems containing*:
 
 - Two bcc Fe surfaces with nanoscale RMS roughness
 - Organic friction modifier (OFM) monolayer films
 - An oil region composed of n-alkane chains
 
*Note that any of these comopents can be excluded from the LAMMPS datafile

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
 - Bash shell
 - Python v2.17.12 
 - moltemplate version v1.34 2015-11-18 : http://www.moltemplate.org/
 - ASE v3.11.0 : https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/

## HOW TO RUN
In a bash shell:
 - Go to the directory where the file run.py and the folder root are located
 - Modify the file run.py as needed
 - Type:
   $ python run.py
 - The folder "lopls" is generated, which contains the files needed to run a LAMMPS simulation
 - To run the LAMMPS simulation, type something like*:
   $ lmp_g++ < in.lopls
   
*note that the name of the LAMMPS executable might be different

## INPUT VARIABLES

The only file which needs to be modified by a regular user is:

 - run.py

## General Inputs

These are the variables that can be modified by the user, they relate to the structure of the system

 - aFe		

Lattice parameter of Fe in Angstrom

 - xhi
 - yhi

Size of the simulation box in the x and y direction. These values need to be given in terms of the lattice parameter of Fe (aFe).
 
For example: xhi = 15, yhi = 15

 - zhi

This value determines the Z size of the section of the box that will contain both the alkane chains and OFMs. The units are Angstrom.

For example: zhi = 60

## Inputs related to the OFMs

 - OFM 	

This flag determines if the the system will contain OFMs. If OFM = 1, the generation of OFMs is activated

 - OFMtype 	

Defines the type of OFM that will be used in the simulation the available options are: SA, SAm, GMS, OA, OAm, GMO. For full details and chemical structures, see: Ewen et al. Langmiur (2016) http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b00586
 
For example: OFMtype = GMS
      
 - OFMn_x
 - OFMn_y

These two variables determine the number of independent OFM chains to be placed along the x and y directions. The inputs are integers.

For example: OFMn_x = 5, OFMn_y = 7

## Inputs related to the Alkanes

 - Alkane 		
 
This flag determines if the the system will contain Alkanes. If Alkane = 1, the generation of Alkanes is activated. Note only linear n-alkanes are currently available.

 - nAlkane

Defines the number of CH2/CH3 monomers on each alkane chain. The inputs are integers.

For example: 	nAlkane = '16'

 - Alkanen_x
 - Alkanen_y
 - Alkanen_z

Number of alkane chains to be placed along each direction of the simulation box. The inputs are integers

For example: 	Alkanen_x = 5, Alkanen_y = 7, Alkanen_z = 3

## Inputs related to the Surfaces

 - Surfaces

This flag determines if the the system will contain Surfaces. If Surfaces = 1, the generation of Surfaces is activated

 - FractalLevels 	

Number of fractal levels used for the generation of the surfaces. The inputs are integers.

For example: 	FractalLevels = 4
      
 - H

Hurst exponent for the generation of the fractal surfaces. Ref: Spijker et al. Tribology Letters (2011) http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11249-011-9846-y

For example: 	H = 0.8

 - RMSin 

Value of the desired RMS roughness of the surfaces. The units are Angstrom.

For example:   RMSin = 8

 - boxLenghtZ

Thicknes of each of the Fe slabs that form the surfaces. This is the thickness before the roughness is applied to the surface This value corresponds to the number of Fe lattice constants (aFe)

For example:  boxLenghtZ = 20
