## GENERAL INFO

This software is suitable as a starting point for performing confined nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of organic friction modifier (OFM) films adsorbed to Fe or Fe2O3 surfaces, separated by a layer of n-alkane or benzyl benzoate molecules.

This software generates a LAMMPS datafile and basic input file for systems containing*:
 
 - Two bcc Fe or Fe2O3 slabs (in the case of pure Fe, the surface can be given random nanoscale roughness)
 - Two OFM monolayers above/below bottom/top solid slabs
 - A central region of linear n-alkane, squalane, or benzyl benzoate molecules
 
*Note that any of these components can be excluded by using the appropriate flags

## SCHEMATIC

The generated system has the following schematic structure:

## INPUT VARIABLES

The only file which needs to be modified by a regular user is:

 - run.py

## General Inputs

These are the variables that can be modified by the user, they relate to the structure of the system

 - boxLenghtX
 - boxLenghtY

Size of the simulation box in the x and y direction. These values need to be given in terms of the lattice parameter of Fe of Fe2O3. Note that the structure of Fe is BCC (a=2.86366A)and that of Fe2O3 is hexagonal (a=5.029A, c=13.730A). 
 
For example: boxLenghtX = 15, boxLenghtY = 15

 - zhi

This value determines the Z size of the section of the box that will contain both the alkane chains and OFMs. The units are Angstrom.

For example: zhi = 60

## Inputs related to the OFMs

 - OFM 	

This flag determines if the the system will contain OFMs. If OFM = 1, the generation of OFMs is activated

 - OFMtype 	

Defines the type of OFM that will be used in the simulation the available options are: SA, SAm, GMS, OA, OAm, GMO. For full details and chemical structures, see: Ewen et al. Langmiur (2016) http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b00586
 
For example: OFMtype = GMS
      
 - OFMn_x
 - OFMn_y

These two variables determine the number of independent OFM chains to be placed along the x and y directions. The inputs are integers.

For example: OFMn_x = 5, OFMn_y = 7

## Inputs related to the Alkanes

 - Alkane 		
 
This flag determines if the the system will contain Alkanes. If Alkane = 1, the generation of Alkanes is activated. Note only linear n-alkanes are currently available.

 - nAlkane

Defines the number of CH2/CH3 monomers on each alkane chain. The inputs are integers.

For example: 	nAlkane = 16

 - Alkanen_x
 - Alkanen_y
 - Alkanen_z

Number of alkane chains to be placed along each direction of the simulation box. The inputs are integers

For example: 	Alkanen_x = 5, Alkanen_y = 7, Alkanen_z = 3

## Inputs related to benzyl benzoate

 - BZBZ

This flag determines if the the system will contain benzyl benzoate. If BZBZ = 1, the generation of benzyl benzoate is activated. 

 - BZBZn_x
 - BZBZn_y
 - BZBZn_z

Number of benzyl benzoate molecules to be placed along each direction of the simulation box. The inputs are integers

## Inputs related to squalane



## Inputs related to the Surfaces

 - Surfaces

This flag determines if the the system will contain Surfaces.
       if Surfaces = 0, do not generate surfaces
       if Surfaces = 1, generate a rough Fe surface
       if Surfaces = 2, generate a flat Fe2O3 surface

 - FractalLevels 	

Number of fractal levels used for the generation of the surfaces. The inputs are integers. Valid if Surfaces = 1

For example: 	FractalLevels = 4
      
 - H

Hurst exponent for the generation of the fractal surfaces. Ref: Spijker et al. Tribology Letters (2011) http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11249-011-9846-y. Valid if Surfaces = 1

For example: 	H = 0.8

 - RMSin 

Value of the desired RMS roughness of the surfaces. The units are Angstrom. Valid if Surfaces = 1

For example:   RMSin = 8

 - boxLenghtZ

Thicknes of each of the Fe slabs that form the surfaces. This is the thickness before the roughness is applied to the surface This value corresponds to the number of Fe or Fe2O3 lattice constants 

For example:  boxLenghtZ = 20

## OUTPUT FILES

After running run.py, you should get the following files in the lopls folder, which can be used to run a LAMMPS simulation.

 - lopls/in.lopls
 
Basic LAMMPS input files for minimisation of lopls.data. We recommend changing this file to perform more complex simulations e.g. NEMD

 - lopls/lopls.data
 
LAMMPS datafile for slab-OFM-alkane-OFM-slab system.

 - lopls/lopls.in.charges
 
LAMMPS partial charges for L-OPLS atom types

 - lopls/lopls.in.init
 
LAMMPS units, atom_style, bond_style, angle_style, dihedral_style, pair_style, special_bonds, kspace_style etc.

 - lopls/lopls.in.settings
 
LAMMPS pair_coeff, bond_coeff, angle_coeff, dihedral_coeff etc.

## Notes

The script could be modified to simulate any confined system in LAMMPS using a range of force-fields. Please contact the authors if you would like help making these modifications.
